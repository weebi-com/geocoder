# simple geocoder

a simple program to find object coordinates

## how to use
create a csv file like test.csv
keep object id in the first column
only use localization fields in the other columns
latitude and longitude they will be appended in the output.csv

put the filename in main.rb then run :

ruby main.rb

## note
the location query is printed in the console to double check
the output file is written line by line so all is not kept in memory
1sec sleep constraint to avoid overflowing the api
works for file with +100k lines and around 10Mo
